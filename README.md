<b>Step 0: Install git and create a GitHub account </b>
- The first two things you'll want to do are install git and create a free GitHub account.

Follow the instructions here to install git (if it's not already installed). Note that for this tutorial we will be using git on the command line only. While there are some great git GUIs (graphical user interfaces), I think it's easier to learn git using git-specific commands first and then to try out a git GUI once you're more comfortable with the command. <br /> 

Once you've done that, create a GitHub account here.  (Accounts are free for public repositories, but there's a charge for private repositories.)
